      "Credit conditions have stabilized, with an LBO Feasibility Index of 78.0 signaling a return to platform-scale acquisitions.",
      "The 5.0x - 6.0x leverage range necessitates a shift from 'growth at any cost' to sustainable EBITDA margins to service debt.",
      "A Tech sector SPI of 6.9 suggests moderate industry outperformance, making software targets with recurring revenue highly attractive for leveraged structures."
    ],
    "regime_guidance": "The current regime is characterized by tight credit spreads (HY at 3.8 and IG at 1.1), creating a 'Goldilocks' environment for mid-market software buyouts. With an LBO Feasibility Index of 78.0, the cost of capital is sufficiently low to support 5.5x leverage without crippling debt service coverage ratios. Firms should prioritize 'Rule of 40' companies that can justify the upper bound of the 5.0x-6.0x leverage range through high-visibility cash flows.",
    "industry_dynamics": "The software sector is currently operating at a Strategic Performance Index (SPI) of 6.9, which sits above the broader market average, indicating robust underlying demand. However, the lack of specific company-level drivers in the current sample suggests a macro-driven market where valuation multiples are sensitive to the 3.8% HY spread. The primary lever for value creation in this regime is multiple expansion through platform bolt-ons rather than organic expansion alone.",
