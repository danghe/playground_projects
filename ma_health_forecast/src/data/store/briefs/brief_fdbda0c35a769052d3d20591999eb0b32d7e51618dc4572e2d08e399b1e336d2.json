Favorable financing conditions, evidenced by a 78/100 LBO Feasibility Index and tight IG spreads (1.1%), are facilitating a wave of balance sheet repairs. We expect a surge in strategic M&A and LBO activity as buyers leverage their combined $700B+ firepower to acquire distressed or stalling assets.",
