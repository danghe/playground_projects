    "executive_summary": "The tech sector is currently defined by a significant supply/demand imbalance where high-leverage sellers (many exceeding 6.0x) are being forced into strategic reviews due to growth stalls, while cash-rich buyers with low leverage (<2x) possess unprecedented firepower. Financing remains highly accessible with an LBO Feasibility Index of 78/100 and tight IG spreads (1.1%), making large-scale take-privates and strategic consolidations viable. Current deal flow is being driven by the urgent need for incumbents to acquire AI infrastructure and cybersecurity capabilities to jumpstart stalled organic growth.",
