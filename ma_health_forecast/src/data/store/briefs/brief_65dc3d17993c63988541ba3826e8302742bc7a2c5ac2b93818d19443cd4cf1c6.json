    "executive_summary": "The tech sector is currently defined by a supply/demand mismatch where over-leveraged legacy players (4.9x-5.7x) are being forced into strategic reviews and carve-outs to meet a buyer pool with significant dry powder. While financing capacity is capped at 4-5x leverage, the presence of cash-rich consolidators like SONY and WIT ensures liquidity for high-quality assets. Current deals are driven by portfolio simplification and activist pressure rather than traditional LBO-led growth.",
