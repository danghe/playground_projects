    "executive_summary": "The Financials sector is currently characterized by a massive demand-supply mismatch, with global megabanks (particularly Japanese entities) holding trillions in firepower against a backdrop of highly leveraged structural sellers (leverage peaks of 14x-21x). While LBO feasibility is healthy at 78/100, the sheer scale of the leverage on seller balance sheets makes strategic acquisitions and portfolio carve-outs more viable than pure-play private equity buyouts. We are seeing a unique window where 'Growth Stall' buyers can acquire market-leading platforms at a discount due to seller debt-stress and revenue contraction.",
