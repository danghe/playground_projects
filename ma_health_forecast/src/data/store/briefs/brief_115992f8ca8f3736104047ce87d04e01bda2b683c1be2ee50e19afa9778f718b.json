      "Credit markets have thawed significantly, with HY spreads at 3.8% providing a predictable window for refinancing and new acquisitions.",
      "Real Estate remains a laggard sector with an SPI of 24.1, suggesting a 'value' play where entry multiples are suppressed despite improving LBO feasibility.",
      "LBO feasibility has reached a robust 78.0, shifting the strategy from capital preservation to aggressive portfolio consolidation using 5.0x - 6.0x leverage."
    ],
    "regime_guidance": "The current regime is characterized by stable credit accessibility. With IG spreads tight at 1.1% and HY spreads at 3.8%, the market is rewarding cash-flow-heavy assets that can service 5.0x-6.0x leverage. This is a 'Goldilocks' environment for Real Estate Private Equity: financing is available but not yet 'bubbly,' and sector valuations (SPI 24.1) remain attractive for long-term entry.",
    "industry_dynamics": "The Real Estate sector is currently operating in a bifurcated state. While the Sector Performance Index (SPI) is low at 24.1, indicating equity-side skepticism, the debt-side metrics (LBO Feasibility 78.0) suggest a disconnect that favors private equity buyers over public markets. Institutional investors can exploit this 53.9 point spread between feasibility and performance to take underperforming REITs private or execute roll-up strategies in fragmented sub-sectors.",
