    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently undergoing a structural 'Balance Sheet Re-alignment' as highly levered incumbents (WEX, ORCL, LPL) look to divest non-core assets to bridge the gap between their current debt (up to 5.7x) and market leverage capacity (4-5x). While Sale Pressure Index scores are moderate for most, SSNC presents a high-urgency situation driven by activist pressure and margin compression. Strategic buyers with massive cash firepower like SONY and WIT are well-positioned to capitalize on this supply of assets to offset their own growth stalls.",
