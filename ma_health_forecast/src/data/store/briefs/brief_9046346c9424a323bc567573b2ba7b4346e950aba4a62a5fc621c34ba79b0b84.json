    "executive_takeaways": [
      "The 'Now' focuses on capital efficiency as HY spreads at 3.8 allow for disciplined leverage, shifting away from zero-rate speculative growth.",
      "The 'Next' involves a surge in take-private activity facilitated by a high LBO Feasibility Index of 78.0, targeting mature SaaS with steady cash flows.",
      "PE firms must pivot from multiple expansion to operational EBITDA growth, as leverage remains capped at 5.0x - 6.0x."
    ],
    "regime_guidance": "In the current regime dated 2026-01-18, the narrow IG spread of 1.1 and HY spread of 3.8 indicate a 'Goldilocks' environment for credit. This stability allows for predictable debt servicing. The LBO Feasibility Index of 78.0 suggests that while credit is accessible, the market is pricing in moderate risk, favoring 'Buy and Build' strategies over mega-buyouts. This regime works best for mid-market tech firms that can support 5.0x - 6.0x leverage without breaching covenants during potential volatility spikes.",
    "industry_dynamics": "The Tech sector is currently maintaining a strong performance profile with an Avg SPI of 6.9. While the 'Top Company Drivers' sample is currently thin, the aggregate data indicates that the sector is benefiting from stabilized credit costs. The spread between IG (1.1) and HY (3.8) of 2.7 points suggests a healthy premium for riskier tech assets, encouraging lenders to support deals in the 5.0x to 6.0x leverage range. Strategic acquirers are focusing on consolidation within fragmented sub-sectors to achieve the scale necessary to justify current SPI levels.",
