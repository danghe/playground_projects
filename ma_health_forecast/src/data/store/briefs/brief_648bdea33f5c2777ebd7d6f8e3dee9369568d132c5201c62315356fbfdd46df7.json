    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A landscape is currently defined by a supply side under pressure from high leverage (averaging ~5x) and activist-driven strategic reviews, particularly in the mid-to-large cap segments like SS&C and Oracle. Conversely, the demand side is robust, with cash-rich entities like Sony, Wipro, and UMC holding massive 'firepower' but facing organic growth stalls. Given the 4-5x leverage capacity ceiling, the market is primed for strategic carve-outs and high-FCF consolidations rather than highly levered whole-company LBOs.",
