    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A market is currently bifurcated between cash-rich global giants (SONY, WIT, UMC) facing growth stalls and highly levered incumbents (LPL, WEX, ORCL) forced into strategic reviews by debt pressure. With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, transactions are shifting toward asset-specific carve-outs and distressed whole-company acquisitions. Current financing realities favor strategic buyers with high FCF over traditional LBO players due to the feasibility gap in high-leverage environments.",
