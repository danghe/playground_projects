    "environment_status": "Bifurcated Deleveraging Window: Strategic Consolidators vs. Over-Leveraged Growth Laggards",
    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A landscape is currently defined by a stark divide between cash-rich consolidators with low leverage and legacy players facing 'Growth Stalls' and debt pressures (4.9x-5.7x). While leverage capacity remains stable at 4-5x, several high-SPI targets currently exceed these levels, making them prime candidates for strategic acquisitions by cash-heavy buyers like SONY and WIT rather than traditional LBOs. The focus has shifted from high-multiple growth to portfolio simplification and 'Buy or Die' inorganic growth strategies for giants facing their own organic stalls.",
