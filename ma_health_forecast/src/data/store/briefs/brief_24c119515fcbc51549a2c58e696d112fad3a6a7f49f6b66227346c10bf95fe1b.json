    "environment_status": "Strategic Realignment & High-Leverage Divestiture Window",
    "executive_summary": "The tech sector is currently characterized by a supply-demand imbalance where highly levered legacy players (WEX, LPL, ORCL) are forced into strategic reviews and carve-outs, meeting a buyer class (SONY, WIT, UMC) with massive cash reserves but stalled organic growth. While leverage capacity is capped at 4-5x, preventing large-scale speculative LBOs, the environment is ripe for strategic consolidations and distressed asset acquisitions. Deals are currently most feasible for cash-rich strategics capable of absorbing assets without relying on heavy external debt markets.",
