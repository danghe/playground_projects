    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A market is currently driven by a surplus of supply from high-leverage incumbents (4.9x-5.7x) seeking to rationalize portfolios under activist pressure. While leverage capacity remains capped at 4-5x, preventing aggressive LBOs, massive 'firepower' from buyers like SONY, WIT, and UMC provides a deep liquidity pool for strategic divestitures. Activity is concentrated in non-core carve-outs and distressed consolidations rather than growth-at-any-cost acquisitions.",

      "WIT -> SSNC (FinTech Carve-out): WIT utilizes its $881.3B firepower to acquire SSNC's high-margin FinTech assets during an activist-driven review. (Strategic M&A, Est. $2.0B - $4.0B)",
