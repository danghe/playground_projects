    "executive_summary": "The tech sector is currently experiencing a supply-demand imbalance where high-leverage players (LPL, WEX) and activist-targeted firms (SSNC) are forced to prune portfolios, creating a surplus of carve-out assets. Concurrently, cash-rich consolidators like SONY, WIT, and UMC are demonstrating extreme 'Buyer Readiness' to offset organic growth stalls. Given the 4-5x leverage capacity, strategic acquisitions and corporate divestitures are significantly more feasible than large-scale, high-multiple LBOs.",
