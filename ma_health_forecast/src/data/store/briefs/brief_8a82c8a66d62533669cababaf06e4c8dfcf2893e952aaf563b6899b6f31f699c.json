    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where high-leverage incumbents (4.9x-5.7x) are forced to prune assets to meet a 4-5x financing reality. Demand is robust from 'Growth Stall' strategics with massive firepower ($300B-$5.8T) seeking AI and infrastructure offsets. Carve-outs and strategic de-leveraging transactions are currently more feasible than traditional mega-LBOs given the tight leverage capacity.",
