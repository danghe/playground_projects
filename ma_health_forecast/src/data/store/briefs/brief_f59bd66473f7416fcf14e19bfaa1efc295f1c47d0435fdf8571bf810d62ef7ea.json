    "environment_status": "Strategic Rebalancing under Leverage Constraints",
    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is witnessing a stark divergence between highly levered legacy players (ORCL, WEX, LPL) seeking de-leveraging via carve-outs and cash-rich strategics (SONY, UMC, WIT) hunting for growth. With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, pure LBOs face friction, favoring strategic consolidators with low debt and high free cash flow. Current conditions prioritize portfolio simplification and activist-driven divestitures over speculative whole-company acquisitions.",
