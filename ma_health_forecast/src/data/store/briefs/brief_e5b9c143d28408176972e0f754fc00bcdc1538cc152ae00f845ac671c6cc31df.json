    "environment_status": "Deleveraging-Driven Divestiture Window with Strategic Consolidation",
    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently experiencing a supply-side surge in carve-out candidates and forced sellers driven by high leverage (5.0x+) and activist pressure (SSNC). While buyer firepower remains exceptionally high among cash-rich strategics like SONY and WIT, deal execution is constrained by a 4-5x leverage capacity, favoring strategic acquisitions over traditional LBOs. The immediate opportunity lies in portfolio simplification for large caps and the absorption of distressed 'WholeCo' targets by growth-hungry consolidators.",
