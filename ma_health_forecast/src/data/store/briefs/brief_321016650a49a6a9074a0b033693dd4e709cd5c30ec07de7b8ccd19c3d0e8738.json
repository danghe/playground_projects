    "executive_takeaways": [
      "Credit conditions are currently optimal for platform consolidation, with IG spreads at 1.1 and HY spreads at 3.8 providing a favorable backdrop for debt-financed acquisitions.",
      "LBO Feasibility has reached a high-conviction level of 78.0, suggesting that financial sponsors can move aggressively on mid-market financial services firms.",
      "Current leverage ranges of 5.0x - 6.0x allow for significant equity amplification in capital-intensive sub-sectors like specialty finance and leasing."
    ],
    "regime_guidance": "The market is in a 'Constructive Consolidation' phase. With IG spreads at 1.1, senior debt is attractively priced for investment-grade financial institutions. The LBO Feasibility Index of 78.0 indicates that private equity returns are no longer compressed by prohibitive financing costs. This regime favors 'Buy-and-Build' strategies in fragmented markets where multiple arbitrage can be realized through scale.",
    "industry_dynamics": "The Financials sector shows an Average SPI of 5.3, indicating moderate but stable growth. In this regime, the spread between HY (3.8) and IG (1.1) of 2.7 suggests that risk appetite is healthy but not reckless. Financial institutions are shifting from defensive liquidity preservation to offensive capital deployment, specifically targeting tech-enabled fee-income streams to offset any potential compression in net interest margins.",
