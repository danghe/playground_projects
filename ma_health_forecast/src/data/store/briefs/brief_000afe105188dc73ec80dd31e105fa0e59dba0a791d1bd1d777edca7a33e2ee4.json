    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A market is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where high-firepower strategics like SONY and WIT are seeking inorganic growth to offset stalling organic performance, while sellers like LPL and SSNC are under intense pressure to de-lever or appease activists. Financing remains a constraint with leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, favoring strategic acquirers with low existing debt over traditional LBO players. This environment uniquely supports carve-outs and opportunistic acquisitions of distressed mid-cap assets.",
