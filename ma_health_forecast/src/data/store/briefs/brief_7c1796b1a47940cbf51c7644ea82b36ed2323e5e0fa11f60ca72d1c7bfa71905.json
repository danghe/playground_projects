    "environment_status": "Deleveraging-Driven Carve-out Window",
    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A market is currently dominated by a 'Deleverage-or-Divest' mandate, as major players like WEX and LPL face leverage levels (5.7x-5.8x) that exceed current financing capacity (4-5x). This supply-side pressure is met by massive buyer firepower from global strategics like SONY and WIT, who are seeking to offset growth stalls with inorganic acquisitions. High-margin carve-outs and whole-company acquisitions of distressed targets are the most feasible deal structures in the current environment.",
