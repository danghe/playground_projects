    "environment_status": "Strategic Divestiture & Consolidator Resilience",
    "executive_summary": "The tech sector is experiencing a supply-side surge driven by high leverage and activist-led strategic reviews, creating a buyer's market for cash-rich consolidators. With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, high-leverage sellers like LPL (6.6x) and WEX (5.7x) are forced to explore divestitures to repair balance sheets. We see an immediate opportunity for strategic consolidators with low leverage to acquire high-quality recurring revenue assets and specialized infrastructure to offset organic growth stalls.",
