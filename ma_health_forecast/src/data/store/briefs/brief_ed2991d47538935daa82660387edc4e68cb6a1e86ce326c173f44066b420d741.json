      "Credit conditions have normalized, shifting the focus from liquidity preservation to aggressive platform consolidation in fragmented sub-sectors.",
      "The 5.0x - 6.0x leverage window allows for competitive bidding on high-quality MedTech and Healthcare Services assets that were previously sidelined.",
      "A Sector SPI of 9.7 indicates a high-performance environment where valuation discipline is critical to avoid overpaying for perceived stability."
    ],
    "regime_guidance": "With HY spreads at 3.8 and an LBO Feasibility Index of 78.0, the current regime favors 'Buy and Build' strategies over pure distressed plays. The 1.1 IG spread provides a cheap cost of capital for senior debt, allowing sponsors to layer in 5.0x - 6.0x leverage efficiently. This is an optimal window for secondary buyouts or carve-outs of non-core divisions from larger healthcare conglomerates looking to deleverage or refocus.",
    "industry_dynamics": "The Healthcare sector is navigating a period of valuation expansion, as evidenced by the 9.7 SPI. Despite labor cost pressures, the stability of reimbursement cycles and the availability of credit at 3.8 HY spreads are driving demand. The narrow 1.1 IG spread suggests that large-cap healthcare companies have significant balance sheet strength, potentially limiting the supply of distressed assets but increasing competition for premium targets.",
