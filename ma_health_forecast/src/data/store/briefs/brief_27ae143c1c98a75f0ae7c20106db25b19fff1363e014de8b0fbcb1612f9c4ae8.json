    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where cash-rich, growth-starved stalwarts like SONY and WIT are facing a market of sellers driven by high leverage and activist pressure. While leverage capacity is constrained at 4-5x, forced sellers like LPL (6.5x) and WEX (5.7x) are creating rare entry points for strategic buyers. Transactions are pivoting away from pure LBOs toward strategic carve-outs and recapitalizations where balance sheet strength is the primary competitive advantage.",
