    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A landscape is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where high-leverage incumbents (LPL, WEX) and activist-targeted firms (SSNC) are entering a forced strategic review phase. While leverage capacity is constrained at 4-5x, 'stalled growth' titans like SONY, WIT, and UMC possess massive cash reserves (firepower) and are actively hunting for AI and infrastructure assets. Current market conditions favor strategic carve-outs and whole-company acquisitions of distressed sellers over traditional high-leverage LBOs.",
