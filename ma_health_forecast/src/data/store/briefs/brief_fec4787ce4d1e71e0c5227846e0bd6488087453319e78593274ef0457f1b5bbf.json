    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A market is characterized by a significant supply of strategic carve-outs as large-cap players like ORCL and XYZ look to de-lever from 4.9x-5.7x levels. While leverage capacity remains capped at 4-5x, demand is robust from high-firepower strategics like SONY and WIT who are seeking M&A to offset growth stalls. Current conditions favor surgical carve-outs and mid-market distressed acquisitions over large-scale, highly levered take-privates.",
