    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A environment is currently bifurcated, with highly levered incumbents (4.9x-6.2x) forced into strategic reviews and carve-outs to stabilize balance sheets. This supply is being met by 'Growth-Stalled' strategic buyers with massive cash firepower and low leverage (<2x) seeking to acquire recurring revenue and AI-adjacent infrastructure. While financing capacity is capped at 4-5x, the high firepower of cash-rich strategics makes large-scale carve-outs and whole-company acquisitions of distressed targets highly feasible.",
