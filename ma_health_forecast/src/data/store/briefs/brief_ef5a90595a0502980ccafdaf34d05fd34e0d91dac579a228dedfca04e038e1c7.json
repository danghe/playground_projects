    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A landscape is currently dominated by high-leverage incumbents (4.9x-5.7x) seeking to simplify portfolios through carve-outs to manage debt loads. Conversely, a group of cash-rich 'Growth-Stalled' buyers like SONY and WIT possess significant firepower and low leverage (<2x) to absorb these assets. Current financing capacity of 4-5x leverage makes mid-market carve-outs and strategic consolidations highly feasible, while distressed WholeCo acquisitions are emerging for targets with valuation multiples under 5x.",
