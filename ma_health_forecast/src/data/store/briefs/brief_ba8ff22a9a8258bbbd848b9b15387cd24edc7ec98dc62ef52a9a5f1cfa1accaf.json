    "executive_takeaways": [
      "The 2026 energy landscape has pivoted from pure-play upstream consolidation to a 'Power-to-Data' infrastructure race, driven by the massive electricity demands of AI scaling.",
      "Credit conditions are highly favorable for mid-market LBOs, with an LBO Feasibility Index of 78.0 and tight IG spreads of 1.1% allowing for aggressive recapitalizations of infrastructure-heavy assets.",
      "Capital discipline remains the primary public equity mandate, but private equity is finding alpha in 'orphaned' gas assets and grid-stability services that bridge the gap between renewables and baseload demand."
    ],
    "regime_guidance": "The current regime is characterized by 'Constructive Credit Stability.' With HY spreads at 3.8% and IG spreads at 1.1%, the cost of debt is well-calibrated for the 5.0x - 6.0x leverage range. This environment favors 'Buy-and-Build' strategies in oilfield services (OFS) and midstream infrastructure, where cash flow predictability offsets moderate interest rates. The 78.0 feasibility index suggests that even large-cap take-privates are viable if the asset generates a minimum 12% FCF yield.",
    "industry_dynamics": "Analysis of 2024-2025 data shows a maturing Permian Basin, where the top five players now control over 60% of production. This consolidation has pushed PE-backed firms toward the Rockies and Eagle Ford, or into the energy transition supply chain. Natural gas remains the transition winner, with US LNG export capacity reaching record levels in early 2026. However, the 'Energy-AI Nexus' is the newest driver; datacenters are now contracting directly with gas-fired generation and nuclear providers to ensure 24/7 uptime, creating a new sub-asset class of 'Securitized Energy Contracts.'",
