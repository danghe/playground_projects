    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where over-leveraged incumbents like LPL (6.3x) and WEX (5.7x) are forced to divest assets to align with a 4-5x leverage capacity ceiling. High-FCF consolidators and cash-rich conglomerates such as SONY and WIT are well-positioned to acquire growth-stalled assets at distressed valuations. Strategic carve-outs are the most feasible deal structures today, allowing sellers to repair balance sheets without abandoning core operations.",
