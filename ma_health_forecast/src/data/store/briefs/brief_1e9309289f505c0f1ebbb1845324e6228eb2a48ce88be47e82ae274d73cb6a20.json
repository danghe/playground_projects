    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A market is currently defined by a supply-side push from high-leverage firms (ORCL, WEX, XYZ) seeking to de-lever through strategic carve-outs, juxtaposed against cash-rich buyers (SONY, WIT, UMC) facing growth stalls. Financing capacity is constrained at 4-5x leverage, making large-scale LBOs secondary to strategic acquisitions and portfolio cleanup. We see a specific 'recycling' trend where firms like SSNC are simultaneously shedding low-margin assets while acting as consolidators of distressed recurring revenue.",
