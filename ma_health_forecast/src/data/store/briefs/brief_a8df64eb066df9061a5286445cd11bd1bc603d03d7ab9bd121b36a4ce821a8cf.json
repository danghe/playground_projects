    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A landscape is currently dominated by a supply-side surge in carve-out opportunities as highly leveraged players like Oracle and WEX seek to simplify portfolios. While leverage capacity is capped at 4-5x, preventing aggressive LBOs, massive cash reserves from buyers like Sony and Wipro ($1.4T+ combined firepower) create a strong bid for high-quality strategic assets. We see a unique window where 'Forced Sellers' like LPL and strategic divesters are meeting cash-rich consolidators looking to solve growth stalls.",
