    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently defined by a sharp bifurcation between 'Firepower Giants' with low leverage (SONY, WIT, ACN) and over-leveraged 'Stalled Growth' entities (DDOG, DAY, CWAN). With an LBO Feasibility Index of 78/100 and tight IG spreads at 1.1%, the environment is ripe for large-scale take-privates and strategic rescues of high-leverage software firms. Current supply is driven by strategic reviews and debt pressure, while demand is focused on AI infrastructure and cybersecurity to reignite growth.",
