    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A landscape is currently defined by a structural supply/demand imbalance where high-leverage incumbents (ORCL, WEX) and activist-targeted firms (SSNC) are being forced into strategic reviews. While financing capacity remains capped at 4-5x leverage, significant buyer firepower from cash-rich consolidators like SONY and WIT ($500B+ firepowers) is creating a window for large-scale divestitures. Strategic carve-outs and bolt-ons for AI infrastructure are the most feasible deal types in the current credit environment.",
