    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where high-firepower strategics (SONY, WIT, UMC) are hunting for growth to offset stalling organic momentum, while legacy giants (ORCL, SSNC) are pressured by high leverage and activists to divest. Although financing is constrained with a 4-5x leverage cap, buyers with significant cash reserves are positioned to exploit 'forced seller' situations and high-SPI carve-outs. We anticipate a surge in divestitures as firms seek to optimize balance sheets in a high-rate environment.",
