    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A market is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where high-leverage incumbents (averaging 5.0x+ debt) are being forced into strategic reviews and carve-outs. While financing is constrained by a 4-5x leverage cap, a tier of cash-rich strategics with 'Growth Stall' issues (SONY, WIT, UMC) possess massive firepower to absorb these assets. Deals are currently feasible as targeted carve-outs rather than large-scale WholeCo consolidations due to valuation distress and activist pressure.",
