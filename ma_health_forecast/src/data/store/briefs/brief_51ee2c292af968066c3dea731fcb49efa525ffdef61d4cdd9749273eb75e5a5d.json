    "environment_status": "Bifurcated Market: Strategic De-leveraging Meets Cash-Rich Consolidation",
    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A landscape is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where high-leverage incumbents (ORCL, WEX, LPL) are forced into strategic reviews, while cash-rich consolidators (SONY, WIT, UMC) seek to offset growth stalls. With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, pure-play LBOs remain challenging, favoring strategic carve-outs and whole-company acquisitions by low-leverage buyers. SSNC represents a unique 'portfolio churn' opportunity, acting simultaneously as a high-readiness buyer and a high-pressure seller of non-core FinTech assets.",
