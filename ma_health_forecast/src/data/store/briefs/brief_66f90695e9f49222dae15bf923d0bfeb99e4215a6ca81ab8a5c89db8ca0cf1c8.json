Conversely, a group of 'clean-balance-sheet' buyers like ZTO and ASR possess over $110B in combined firepower and are aggressively seeking robotics and automation assets. With LBO feasibility at 78/100 and favorable IG spreads (1.1%), the market is primed for both massive strategic consolidations and take-private transactions of distressed mid-caps.",
