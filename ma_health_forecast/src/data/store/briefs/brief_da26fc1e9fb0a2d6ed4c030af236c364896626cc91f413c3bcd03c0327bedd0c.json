With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, assets with 5x+ leverage are under intense pressure to divest non-core segments, creating a fertile environment for strategic carve-outs. We are seeing a unique 'Fix and Grow' dynamic where consolidators like SSNC are simultaneously divesting underperforming units while seeking high-FCF recurring revenue assets.",
