    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A market is characterized by a supply-side surge in carve-out candidates as legacy players (ORCL, SSNC, XYZ) face activist pressure and high leverage (4.9x-6.4x) exceeding current 4-5x market capacity. Meanwhile, a tier of 'Cash-Rich Giants' (SONY, WIT, UMC) with massive firepower and low leverage are actively seeking growth to offset stalling organic numbers. Feasible deals are currently centered on strategic carve-outs and distressed 'WholeCo' acquisitions where buyers can use cash to bypass expensive debt markets.",
