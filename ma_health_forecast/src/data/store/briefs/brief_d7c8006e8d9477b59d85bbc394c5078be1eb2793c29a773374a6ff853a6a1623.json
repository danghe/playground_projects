    "environment_status": "Opportunistic Strategic Consolidation Amidst Debt-Driven Divestitures",
    "executive_summary": "The tech M&A market is currently defined by a supply/demand divergence where highly levered legacy players (4.9x-5.7x) are forced into strategic reviews, while cash-rich consolidators with growth stalls are sitting on record firepower. With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, traditional LBOs face friction, making all-cash strategic carve-outs and whole-company acquisitions of distressed assets the most feasible deal structures. This creates a prime environment for 'Growth-Stall Arbitrage' where low-leverage buyers acquire distressed organic growth at compressed multiples.",
