    "executive_summary": "The Tech M&A landscape is currently defined by a sharp divergence between highly leveraged legacy players shedding non-core assets and cash-rich conglomerates seeking inorganic growth to offset stagnating organic performance. While leverage capacity remains capped at 4-5x, curbing mega-LBO feasibility, the market is ripe for strategic carve-outs and tactical consolidations. SS&C Technologies (SSNC) serves as the market's focal point, simultaneously acting as an activist-pressured seller and a recurring-revenue-focused buyer.",
