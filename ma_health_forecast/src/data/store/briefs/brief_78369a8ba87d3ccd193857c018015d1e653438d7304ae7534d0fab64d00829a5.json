    "environment_status": "Strategic Realignment and Leverage Rationalization",
    "executive_summary": "The tech sector is currently defined by a supply/demand imbalance where high-firepower buyers like WIT and SONY are actively seeking growth to offset organic stalls, while targets like SSNC and ORCL face significant de-leveraging and activist pressure. Financing capacity remains constrained at 4-5x leverage, making large-scale LBOs challenging but favoring strategic 'cash-and-stock' consolidations. Current market conditions prioritize carve-outs of non-core assets from highly levered conglomerates to satisfy both seller debt mandates and buyer growth requirements.",
