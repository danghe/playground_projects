    "environment_status": "Strategic Realignment & Carve-out Surge",
    "executive_summary": "The tech sector is currently defined by a 'Portfolio Rotation' cycle where high-leverage incumbents (ORCL, WEX, LPL) are forced to divest non-core assets to manage debt loads, while cash-rich strategics (SONY, WIT, UMC) seek to bridge growth stalls. With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, deal-making is pivoting away from high-premium LBOs toward strategic carve-outs and distress-driven consolidation. This creates a high-velocity window for buyers with strong FCF and low leverage to acquire quality assets at valuation discounts.",
