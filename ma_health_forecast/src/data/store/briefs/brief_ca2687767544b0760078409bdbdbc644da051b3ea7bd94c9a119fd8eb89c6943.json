    "environment_status": "Strategic Realignment: High-Firepower Pivot Amid Growth Stagnation",
    "executive_summary": "The Tech sector is currently defined by a 'Portfolio Pivot' where legacy incumbents like SONY and LPL are simultaneously divesting distressed assets and deploying massive cash reserves to solve growth stalls. With leverage capacity capped at 4-5x, the market heavily favors cash-rich strategic acquirers over financial sponsors, as evidenced by high Buyer Readiness scores across the semiconductor and services sub-sectors. We are seeing a supply-side cluster of forced whole-company sales driven by valuation distress, creating a unique window for top-tier consolidators to acquire scale at sub-5x multiples.",
